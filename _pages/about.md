### From Fast Prototyping to Scalable Design For Smart Textiles Fabrication

Smart textile interfaces are increasingly central to SIGGRAPH’s broader conversation, around interactive fabrication, soft/hybrid materials, and next-generation input/output devices. From computational design to motion capture or soft haptic suits for immersive experiences, this course introduces anatomies, fabrication techniques and emerging capabilities of smart textiles that are reshaping our industries. 
The subjects cover end-to-end introductions to smart textiles: from designing to integration through selecting functional yarns, to embedding sensing, inference, actuation, directly into fiber, or fabric. Grounded in long-running interdisciplinary research across our labs from HCI to Materials Science, Textile Engineering, Micro Electronics and Computer Science, the course prioritizes fabrication-aware methods that move toward wearable- and product-ready prototypes that behave reliably outside the lab.
Participants will gain a structured overview of key smart textile building blocks; from conductive fibers, textile electrodes for electrostimulation, soft sensors, flexible displays, heating and other fabric-based actuators. The course emphasizes how material choices, design, and textile manufacturing constraints shape cost, scalability, durability, performances, comfort, and user experience. 
The participative part of the course will allow attendees to feel the materials as well as test textiles sensors and actuators demonstrators, a unique aspect of this session that takes advantage of its special format. By the end, participants will be able to select appropriate materials, build and characterize a sensorized textile interface, and make informed design decisions that balance aesthetics, comfort, robustness, signal integrity, and even inference, for interaction across application domains.
