### Keynotes
##### Professor Michael Haller: **It’s Just About a Smart Yarn: From Threads to “Intelligent” Interfaces** 

At first glance, a yarn seems ordinary — fragile, flexible, and woven into countless fabrics around us. But what if this yarn could sense pressure, temperature, or even magnetic fields? In this talk, I will show how we can transform traditional fibers into intelligent sensing threads, enabling textiles that act as interactive surfaces and wearable interfaces. By embedding sensors at the yarn level, we create fabrics that not only respond to touch but also monitor motion and physiology. This opens new opportunities for healthcare, sports, mobility, and playful design. I will share our latest prototypes, from knitted pressure sensors to magnetically responsive fibers, and discuss both the challenges and promises of merging textiles with computing. In the end, it’s not just a yarn — it’s the foundation for the next generation of interfaces.

Speaker Bio: 
Michael Haller is a Full Professor at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano in Italy, where he directs the Media Interaction Lab. His research explores physical computing, next-generation interfaces, and human-computer interaction. Over the years, he has pioneered work on mixed reality, interactive surfaces, and smart textiles. He received his Dipl.-Ing., Dr. techn., and Habilitation degrees from Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, and held research positions at HITLab New Zealand, USC in Los Angeles, and the National University of Singapore. His work has been recognized with multiple international awards, including best paper awards at ACM CHI and UIST. Today, his lab bridges theory, design, and engineering to rethink how textiles can evolve into sensing platforms for mobility and creative applications.

##### Professor Lucy Dunne: **Building Soft "Hard"-Wear: Why Soft Stuff is Hard, and Why We Should Do It Anyway**

25+ years after the "first wave" of e-textiles and clothing-based wearables, commercial products are still sparse and struggle to succeed. Wearable interfaces and devices based on hard goods have flourished in the same time frame. This talk will explore the "why" and "why bother" -- what makes textile-based electronic systems so difficult, and why are on-body systems even more challenging? What stands between lab prototypes and commercial products? More importantly, what would we gain by overcoming these barriers? 

Speaker Bio:
Lucy E. Dunne is a professor in the Department of Design Innovation, College of Design at the University of Minnesota, where she founded and co-directs the Wearable Technology Lab. She is a co-author of "Functional Apparel Design: From Sportswear to Space Suits" (Bloomsbury, 2015). Her research is focused on wearability and garment-based wearable technology, and explores new functionality in apparel, human-device interfaces, production and manufacture, and human factors of wearable products. She has received the National Science Foundation’s CAREER award, a US/UK Fulbright Commission fellowship, and the NASA Silver Achievement Medal for her work with functional clothing and wearable technology.
