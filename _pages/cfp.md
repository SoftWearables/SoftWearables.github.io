We invite participants who are experienced in and/or interested in intelligent soft wearables. We call for three kinds of contributions:
* **Interactive Demos** to be showcased during the worshop's demo session: up-to-2-page submission,
* **Experience/Reflection Reports** to be presented during the worshop talk session: up-to-4-page submission, and
* **Work in Progress (WiP)/Position Papers** to be presented during the worshop talk session: up-to-4-page submission.

**Workshop participation is open to everyone**, if the venue space allows, without submitting a demo/report/paper.

### Important Dates
* [x] **~~6/26/25~~ 7/3/25 AoE**: Submission Deadline
* [x] **7/17/25 AoE**: Decision Notification
* [x] **7/24/25 AoE**: Deadline for Camera-Ready Versions to be Included in ACM DL 
* [ ] **10/13/25**: Day of the Workshop 

### Topics of Interest
Submissions areas of interest include (but are not limited to):
* accessible computational design \& digital fabrication toolkits
* scalable manufacturing processes for soft wearables
* sensing, actuation, and/or energy harvesting devices
* sustainable wearables
* applied machine learning for wearables
* multi-function multimodal wearable ecosystems
* evaluating large-scale and long-term deployment
* personalization VS generic one-for-all wearables
* miniaturization for conformability
* wearable technology acceptance

### Preparing for the Submission
All submissions need to be formatted according to the ACM double-column UbiComp-ISWC 2025 Proceedings and managed via the Precision Conference System (PCS). 
To make a new submission on [PCS](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions), select SIGCHI (Society) -> UbiComp/ISWC 2025 (Conference/Journal) -> UbiComp/ISWC 2025 SoftWearables (track).
References and appedices do not count towards page limits.

### Review Process
Workshop submissions undergo single-blind review by 2 reviewers who are organizers of the workshop. 

### Upon Accpetance
Authors of the accepted submissions can choose to have their submissions included in the ACM Digital Library as supplemental proceedings of the conference.

### During the Workshop
All accepted submissions will be presented/showcased during the workshop.
There will be a Best Demo Award, voted anonymously by workshop attendees.
